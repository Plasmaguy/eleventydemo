# Keyboards are fun!

## Layouts

The most common Latin keyboard layout is QWERTY, but it is not the only one. In Europe, it is often instead replaced with AZERTY for ease of typing. Other popular layouts include:
- QWERTZ
- QZERTY
- Ã„WERTY

## Why do we have different layouts?

I'm glad you asked, random hypothetical user! Yes yes, we have different keyboard layouts because different languages have a different set of frequently-used characters. AZERTY, for instance, swaps Q and W with A and Z respectively to deal with Europe's languages - namely, not the English language which I assume you are reading this in.

## Why not standardize?

Because people are familiar with the layout they use the most, and humans are stolid, dumb creatures slow to accept change and highly traditional and dare-I-say tribal about their opinions. Consider the following:

*I qsked my friend q auestion the other dqy. I qsked him, "Whqt on Eqrth qre you eqting?" to zhich he replied "Piwwq."*

You can *kind of* understand it if you squint a little bit and give it some thought, but it's pretty... Bad. This is the result of typing on an AZERTY as one might type on a QWERTY - pretty crappy, right?

So, we're stuck with what we've got for now. Sad times. :(
