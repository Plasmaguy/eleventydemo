# This is my ELEVENTY site!!!

It's a very nice place. It was made through a combination of blood, sweat, tears, code, sweat, tears, code, tears, more tears, sweat, a little bit of blood, an eye of newt, toe of frog, pain, tears, and determination. Mix well in a bowl, let rest for 30 minutes, and place in oven at 420 degrees (preferably Kelvin). Do not stare directly into the aperture.

Do colourless, green ideas dream furiously? Do legless, speedy runners fall jauntily? Do mindless, intelligent cups scream in contentment? Oh, what a world! What a world!

The computer is deep blue, the game is chess, the question is no and the answer is yes. Ponder, contemplate, and realize I am typing this COMPLETELY as stream of consciousness with zero underpinning logic other than filling out paragraphs and making people think they're crazy.

## Now, what's this site all about?

I am glad you asked! It includes...

- Stream of consciousness crazy-writing
- Yapping about whatever topics I damn well choose
- Content that will hopefully get me marks
- This one cool image I made in Photoshop at 2 in the morning!:

Isn't it cool? :D
