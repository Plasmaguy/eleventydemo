     <div class="main"><h1>This is my ELEVENTY site!!!</h1>
<p>It's a very nice place. It was made through a combination of blood, sweat, tears, code, sweat, tears, code, tears, more tears, sweat, a little bit of blood, an eye of newt, toe of frog, pain, tears, and determination. Mix well in a bowl, let rest for 30 minutes, and place in oven at 420 degrees (preferably Kelvin). Do not stare directly into the aperture.</p>
<p>Do colourless, green ideas dream furiously? Do legless, speedy runners fall jauntily? Do mindless, intelligent cups scream in contentment? Oh, what a world! What a world!</p>
<p>The computer is deep blue, the game is chess, the question is no and the answer is yes. Ponder, contemplate, and realize I am typing this COMPLETELY as stream of consciousness with zero underpinning logic other than filling out paragraphs and making people think they're crazy.</p>
<h2>Now, what's this site all about?</h2>
<p>I am glad you asked! It includes...</p>
<ul>
<li>Stream of consciousness crazy-writing</li>
<li>Yapping about whatever topics I damn well choose</li>
<li>Content that will hopefully get me marks</li>
<li>This one cool image I made in Photoshop at 2 in the morning!:</li>
</ul>
